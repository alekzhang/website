This is a starter project for the [Gallery Deluxe](https://github.com/bep/gallerydeluxe) Hugo Module. You need [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) and [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) to run this project.

## Update theme

Run `hugo mod get -u` to update to a newer version of Gallery Deluxe if one exists.

**Note:** This isn't a _theme_; it's meant to be used as a standalone Hugo project. You can edit/add/move files in this project as you please.
